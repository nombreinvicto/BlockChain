Description:

This project involves the design of a private blockchain notary 
service. The service exposes to a user a series of notary endpoints
to endorse digital assets. The endpoints are exposed via the 
design of a REST API sitting ontop of a private blockchain backend
implemented via LevelDB. The interaction layer of the backend 
server that fetches users data by interacting with the LevelDB 
database is based on the NodeJS Express framework.

Usage:

The entry-point of the repository is the file named `app.js`. Any 
NodeJS interpreter can be used to run the file that has a version 
greater than `8.0`. 

* Send a POST request to start the asset notarisation process: 

`http://localhost:8000/requestValidation`

The request body should contain:

`{ "address":"19xaiMqayaNrn3x7AjV5cU4Mk5f5prRVpL" }`

where the address is a valid bitcoin address.

* The user will be given a window of 5 minutes to complete the 
notarisation process, beyond which he has to start over. Use the 
following endpoint to make a POST request to the blockchain server 
to establish user identity via signing a message using wallet 
private-key. The message will be returned as a reply to the user in
 the previous step:

`http://localhost:8000/message-signature/validate`

The request should contain:

`{
"address":"19xaiMqayaNrn3x7AjV5cU4Mk5f5prRVpL",
 "signature":"H8K4+1MvyJo9tcr2YN2KejwvX1oqneyCH+fsUL1z1WBdWmswB9bijeFfOfMqK68kQ5RO6ZxhomoXQG3fkLaBl+Q="
}`

where the signature is a valid sign generated by signing the 
message returned from the previous endpoint. The signing has to be 
done using a bitcoin wallet owned by the wallet address used in the
 previous/current request body. A wallet like [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home) can be used 
 in this case. At this stage, the server will reply with a message 
 acknowledging the notarisation initiation process and will let the
  user know of the remaining time.
 
*  Make a POST request to the following endpoint to register a 
digital asset:

`http://localhost:8000/block`

The request should contain:
`{
    "address": "19xaiMqayaNrn3x7AjV5cU4Mk5f5prRVpL",
    "star": {
                "dec": "68Â° 52' 56.9",
                "ra": "16h 29m 1.0s",
                "story": "Found star using https://www.google.com/sky/"
            }
}`

where address is the wallet address being used as the identity and 
star is the example digital asset being notarised here. The star 
asset need to have some properties like mentioned in the example 
above.

* Make a GET request to the following URL to GET a notarised 
digital asset (star) using a valid block hash in the HASH 
placeholder:

`http://localhost:8000/stars/hash:<HASH>`

* Make a GET request to the following URL to GET a list of all the 
digital assets notarised against a particular wallet address by 
replacing the ADDRESS placeholder with a wallet address.

`http://localhost:8000/stars/address:[ADDRESS]`

* Make a GET request to the following URL to get a block from the 
blockchain by using a valid blockheight number in the HEIGHT 
placeholder.

`http://localhost:8000/block/[HEIGHT]`
